MLP

  MATLAB Presentation

There are two commands:

mlpdoodle - The MLP editor
mlpf - The MLP Frontend for doing a presentation

Both scripts take a string argument: the name of the presentation.
A mat file with that name is created or read for the presentation.

While editing a presentation, it is 'saved' every time you switch pages.
Do not edit a slide, then quit, the presentation would not be saved.
